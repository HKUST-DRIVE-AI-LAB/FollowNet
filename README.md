Source code for the following paper:

Chen, Xianda, et al. "FollowNet: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Car-Following Behavior Modeling." arXiv preprint arXiv:.

## Description
This notebook demonstrate how to achieve the car following models from traditonal models to data driven models. Motivation: given extracted car following events from five open datasets with the same data formate and train the car follow models. Author: Chen Xianda.
The extracted car following events are avaliable for download.
Provide a tutorial of the data format and how to run the traditional models and the data-driven models.

## Data
Extracted car-following events are stored in `data/` folder. The colab tutorial take the highD data for experiments first. 


## Pretrained Models
Pretrained models are stored in `trained_model/` folder.
